Transistor Q1 is rotated. Needs turning 90deg anticlockwise.
- Done on board #2

"ROM Acc 3V3" is on the silkscreen, test point was removed.
Same for "GND" just above U4.

Disconnect the 3V3s for all the Picos. I've got the outputs
of 3 regulators tied together.

The direction for the data bus level shifter needs to be
ROM_READ_INV, not /RD.
 - Cut ZXRD track on back of board #2
 - Picked up ROM_READ_INV from OR output (pin 9) and
   connected to DIR (pin 1) on level shifter U4
 
Move the GND via from pin 19 on U4, it's under the chip and
I can't get to it. This is /OE.

Remove level shifter U2
 - Bridged across gap on board #2

Remove level shifter U3
 - Bridged across gap on board #2
