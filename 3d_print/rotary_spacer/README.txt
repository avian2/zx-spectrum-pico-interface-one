The rotary encoder is a standard KY-040, but those come with
a connector with a 90deg bend in it. The knob sits horizontally.
I want the knob to sit vertically, so I desolder the connector
and solder on a normal 5-pin header. That then solders onto the
main PCB.

The problem then is that the encoder sits a few mm above the PCB,
separated from it by the plastic bit of the header pins. What it
needs to make it sturdy is a small spacer to fit underneath the
encoder's small PCB. Which is what this is.
