A simple spacer to separate the two PCBs at the right distance
apart when soldering the long legged, female sockets.

Solder the header pins protruding from the bottom of the top
layer (the daughterboard). Plug the female sockets onto them.
Line up the boards and thread the legs of the female sockets
into their holes on the main PCB.

Now insert these spacers between the boards at convenient
locations, preferably near the headers/sockets. The gap between
the boards should be 18mm (as of this writing). Clamp the two
boards into position and solder the legs of the female sockets
from the underside of the main PCB. Remove the spacers, the
soldered pins should be strong enough to hold the two boards
in position.
