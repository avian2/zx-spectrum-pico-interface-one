The top panel is a metal plate which sits over the top of the
larger connector which joins the main PCB to the daughterboard.
If the metal plate touches down on the top tips of that connector
it'll short them out.

I made this spacer to fit underneath the metal plate to raise it
up 2mm, which is high enough to lift it clear of the connector.

Put it in place, put the LEDs in their holes, put the metal plate
on top with the LEDs poking though. Fiddly, use tweezers to line
the LEDs up. Then nut and bolt each corner of the plate, check 
the spacer is in position, then screw down and threadlock the
nuts.
