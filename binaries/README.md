# ZX Spectrum Expansion System, Recreated, Binaries

I had a couple of requests for pre-built UF2 files for the Picos.

This rather puzzled me since none of the code is any use without
the hardware, and I figured that anyone capable of building the
hardware would be capable of building the Pico's code.

No matter, I'm happy to provide them if people have a use for them.
